My first GitHub repository

My name is Gavin Brown. I am an undergraduate math major with some experience in programming,
hoping to learn git and GitHub to better solve problems and present myself to potential employers.

Also, I think it will put me way ahead of my classmates in my math modeling class, but that's icing on the cake.
